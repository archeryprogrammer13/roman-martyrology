Augustine, bishop and famous doctor of the 
Church. Converted and baptized by the blessed 
bishop Ambrose, he defended the Catholic faith with 
the greatest zeal against the Manicheans and other 
heretics, and after having sustained many other 
labors for the Church of God, he went to his reward

Sardinia, and afterwards taken by Luitprand, king 
of the Lombards, to Pavia, where they were deposited 
with due honors. At Rome, the birthday of St.

dom by the sword, under the judge Aurelian. At 
Brioude, in Auvergne, St. Julian, martyr, during the

his throat cut. At Coutances, in France, St. Pelagius,

celebrated man, through whose efficacious prayers 
Arius, by the judgment of God, burst asunder and 
exposed his intestines. At Saintes, St. Vivian,
